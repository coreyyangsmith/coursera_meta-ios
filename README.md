## Course 9: React Basics
##### Lecture
In this course, we learned about the development and use of the React library and its component-based architecture. We learned how to create and link React components (and how their vanilla JS counterparts would accomplish something similar). We looked at the difference between props and states, and how we can leverage both to create dynamically generated Single Page Applications (SAP). Finally, we learned how to handle navigation and assets within a React project.
